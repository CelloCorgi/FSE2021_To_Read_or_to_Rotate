## Overview

This repository contains the replication materials for the paper To Read or To Rotate? Comparing the Effects of Technical Reading Training and Spatial Skills Training on Novice Programming Ability as accepted at [ESEC/FSE 2021](https://2021.esec-fse.org/).

## Paper Abstract:

Understanding how to best support and train novice programmers is a critical component of producing better and more diverse software engineers. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled 11-week longitudinal study with 57 CS1 students comparing two skill-based interventions to improve programming performance. The first intervention we consider involves spatial training, an established baseline that is known to be helpful in engineering contexts. The second intervention we consider is a novel computer science focused technical reading training.

In our reading training, we teach strategies for summarizing scientific papers and understanding scientific charts and figures; most of the covered readings were CS1-accessible portions of computer science research papers. For the spatial training, we use a standardized training curriculum previously found to improve programming skills by focusing on spatial ability, the manipulation of shapes in imagination. We first replicate findings that both reading ability and spatial ability are correlated with programming success. Significantly, however, we find that those in our reading training exhibit larger programming ability gains than those in the standard spatial training (*p* = 0.02, f<sup>2</sup> = 0.10). We also find that reading training participants perform particularly well on programming problems that require tracing through code (*p* = 0.03, f<sup>2</sup> = 0.10). Our results suggest that this sort of technical reading training could be a good choice for novices who have not completed a CS1 class. Finally, we present a discussion on the implications of our results on future CS1 interventions, the possibilities for non-programming based training positively impacting software developers, and future directions for software engineering research.
